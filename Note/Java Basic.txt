1. Fields :variable declared outside the Method. 
2. Variable: refer to declarations inside the Method. 
3. Variables: is a name reference to a memory area where the value of the variable is stored. 
4. Syntax variables: [data_Type] [variable_name] = [variable_Value] 
5. data type: type of information that store in the memory


---------------------------------

There are four types of variables: 

1. Instances variable : change to the object that we create = copy 
2. Static variables : no change 
3. Local variables : field 
4. Methods arguments : is the variable that we put inside method 

---------------------------------

1. Instances variable: define in the class but outside the method = field 
- they are call non-static variables 
- also call State variables 
- when we create the object then all of the objects have different instances variable = change variables according to objects it’s created. 
Ex: int i = 10; 
ប្រែប្រួល អញ្ញាត




2. Static variables: which variable declares as the static it is call static variables: 
- or call Class variables 
- no change for the static variables when we create new objects from the class 
Ex. Static int i = 10;

អញ្ញាតមិនប្រែប្រួល អោយតាមាន ពាក្យ Static គឺមិនផ្លាស់ប្តូរទេ

3. Local variables: is the variable we declare inside the Method 
- it have scope only inside the method 
- out side it can not us it 

យើងបង្កើតវានៅក្នុង តែ Method ទេ

4. Method argument: is a variable that pass to the method when the method is called


------------------------------------------------

Data Type: what kind of data which you are storing and holding 

1. Primitive data type ( device into two : one is numeric and floating data type)
2. Non-primitive/ Reference data types

* Primitive data types: 

1- numeric data types: integral data type= data store number អត់ក្នៀស: byte, short, int, long. 

2- floating pint data type: float 0.0f and double 0.0d 

* Non- Numeric data type: 
1. Char : store one character 
2. Boolean data type: store True or False
